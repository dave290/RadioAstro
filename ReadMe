There is an art to fitting.  For example, when fitting 2 peaks
as in this example, you may need to add a third peak with 
a very broad width, and a very low coefficient. This may 
compensate for other contributions to the intensity.

Start by fitting centers first only for Peaks A and B
CenterA=0 
CenterB=-10000
CoefA=10
CoefB=10
sigmaA=5000
sigmaB=5000

Update the center values for A and B and re-fit, 
allowing all parameters to be fit

You will notice the fit to the lower intensity peak
is not great.

Activate peak C in the parameter file.
Set its sigma to something very wide (1000000) and do not allow 
this sigma to vary.

Play with the center position and coefficient and you will 
notice that peak B fit improves.
