Welcome
This repository currently contains the following:  1) Fitting Program to be used to fit DSPIRA radio astronomy data with Gaussian fitting functions, and 2) three separate examples of the above.  The examples with 1 and 2 peaks use "perfect" data that was generated mathematically.  The example with 3 peaks contains actual data recorded with a radio telescope.
